# Unique.c
Program Name:     unique

Author:           Kyle Krueger

Program Input:    stdin

Program Output:   stdout

Allowed Imports:   stdio.h

Unique is a program that reads strings from stdin and extracts only the unique tokens. The unique tokens are sent to stdout. Some challenges I faced during this assignment was creating functions to do the job that strok and strcmp would have done. 
   
A make file was included, allowing "make" and "make clean" to be used in order to compile or remove the object file.
